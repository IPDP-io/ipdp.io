### Setup pre-commit git hooks
    
We have a pre-commit git hook for running prettier on all files to keep the formatting consistent.
    
`git config core.hooksPath "./git_hooks"` - This will set the git config path to use this directory for hooks.
    
`chmod +x ./git_hooks/pre-commit` - This will give the hook the necessary permissions to run.
